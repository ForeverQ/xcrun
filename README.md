# iosim

I frequently have to find specific versions of an app on a particular simulator
version and sometimes it's just really annoying. This script was originally
designed to quickly get me to the documents directory of a given simulator, but
I plan on expanding out so that it's a full wrapper for `xcrun simctl`.
